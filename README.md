- `signIn()`: https://deezbase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin
- `signOut()`: https://deezbase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout

### Custom `fetch` implementation

`auth-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { AuthClient } from '@deezbase/auth-js'

const AUTH_URL = 'http://localhost:9999'

const auth = new AuthClient({ url: AUTH_URL, fetch: fetch })
```
